# Description
To begin with, you will learn how to divide an encrypted message into the characters that it contains. You will need this for further work.

# Objetives
In this stage, your program should:

Read a string from a console. The input contains a single line.
Output all characters in the string, separated by one space (including the space characters themselves).

# Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

````
Example 1:

Input string:
> Greetings!

G r e e t i n g s !
Example 2:

Input string:
> Who am I?

W h o   a m   I ?
